In first part we will write open('flag1.txt','r').read()
In first part we will write  __builtins__.__dict__['eva'+'l']("__builtins__.__dict__['ope'+'n']('flag2.txt', 'r')"+".rea"+"d()")


This was pretty simple cand it was confirmed once I saw the 2nd part. The second problem, well im still stuck on it till the moment, but ill explain it in a breif what i did. 
Firstly i did google to find any function call can open and read a file. But i was unable to find one. So I though that i have to do something else. Then I went to sleep as it was already 4:00 AM, but still unable to sleep i keep on thinnking what to do what to do and finally at 4:30, eureka(or atleast for me it was at that moment) thought what if i encoded the stuff and then sent it in. So i did that and still it didnt work as after decode function the eval function stopped and retured a string namely open('flag2.txt','r').read(). I got frustated and tried using an extra eval but that didnt worked out either. this is the encoded string that i used. b"\xff\xfee\x00v\x00a\x00l\x00(\x00o\x00p\x00e\x00n\x00(\x00'\x00f\x00l\x00a\x00g\x002\x00.\x00t\x00x\x00t\x00'\x00,\x00'\x00r\x00'\x00)\x00.\x00r\x00e\x00a\x00d\x00(\x00)\x00)\x00".decode("utf-16")

Then i googled that this this this i have to do wtiout bbla bla bla and i got  a name called python snadbox problems. And i studied it 5 hrs straight and i am still a bit stuck in it. Finally after trying hundreds of combination firstly i studies how does a eval work and then i did reach till here __builtins__.__dict__['ope'+'n']('flag2.txt','r') but now i was again stuck. i tried to endcode read and decode then using utf-16 but that didint work either so i though and though and just like i concatenated open i thought ill create whole command string and pass it and put an eval over it and hurrey it worked.
