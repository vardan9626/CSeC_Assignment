This problem literally had me scratching my head for hours, what havnt i tried, I tried to solve this problem for 12 hrs and still wasnt able to.
I understood that the problems major part was to discover the contents in the pcapng usb file. 
And that it had data transfer to and from many devices like the arduino board and what not. 
It took me quite a while to understand that it can contain the value of keystrokes, mouse pointers and what not. 
I tried to filter out key presses but when i searched it showed that key presses are indicated by an interrurpt and when i filteres all the interrurps there were very and when i used ctf-usb-keyboard-parser tool then also i didnt find any relevent info.
Then I thought i need to do some more work and i started to read again.

So after a lot of brain stroming i think i found something tho not sure what i found is correct. So i foud that key strokes are in left over capture data.
So i found the commnad to extract leftover data using "tshark -r example.pcap -T fields -e usb.capdata > usbdata.txt" then after i had this i then tried to extract the 5th and 6th character as they are the ones containing keystroke val.
Then I extracted it as a file each line representing a keystroke. Then i mapped the hexadecimal val to real keyboard strokes and found this

where << means backspace.

I also tried another approach tho it didnt work what i did was i installed a sofware which can replay what a usb did if we had the pcapng file of the same i tried to use that but it didnt seem to work out either.
