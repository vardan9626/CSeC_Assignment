The flag for the first problem will be  "CSEC{if_you_had_fought_like_a_man_you_need_not_have_been_hang'd_like_a_dog}".
What i did was firstly I saw what are the contents of the pcap files using wireshark. I tried using strings at it but i got no feasible output.
I did some research on pcap files and figured they may be containing some embedded files in them. I tried to find images in it so i firstly checked wiki that what are the extentions of jpg, jpeg files. I tried to see like what are the endings and startings of the jpeg files in the pcap files bcz sometimes after the ending of file there is some extra data which could have been my flag. But this wasnt the case either bcz there were multiple start and end points and it was not looking feasible to check all of them. So i though i must use a tool and searched the net. Then i used binwalk and saw that there were jpeg and some other files within it. After that i searched how to extract a file from pcap file and found foremost  tool and using that i finally figured it out. I got a jpg file with the flag written on it on top right corner.
